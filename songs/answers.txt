I would check the aura of particular person by averaging each of the column and then
compare each of the averages by  finding the percentage of each part in comparison to all those averages as whole.
here danceability will show positive mood, energy will represent need of energy boost, valence will positiveness conveyed,
tempo will be compared with other states to validate their mood ,  e.g. more slow paced there is more chance of person being emotional and etc.

This is the way I am proposing but it won't be the best way as it's hard to point out peoples mood by only this much data
and also people may be using same account for part and  other various purposes , we have account for such situations.
