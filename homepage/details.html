          <p>This will be my attempted essay to introduce myself, sorry if it will be chaos.</p>
          <p>I am Computer Engineering student currently studying in second year of Savitribai Phule Pune University, Maharashtra, India. My college is nothing to mention about or what they teach but my interest for the miracle of technology pulled me to CS50.</p>
          <p>Indian education system is pretty competitive, which I hate. Here student race for marks and to obtain better college and thereby better job, this ideology made few people even grab profit from this situation in name of coaching. The biggest college in India for technology seeker are IITs which even made their student called out as IITians. The people who setup these coaching classes use this to make it brand use it make student as well their parent to chase these prestigious colleges. This make not interested but who just had scored higher marks get the seat in this college. But this never interest me so I do nothing to score in this so-called great college entrance exam and so I take up any college that come up which I hate if you haven’t noticed I hate. Apart from its education system is the great place or even the greatest place, this place has culture like none.
             ”India is place where water change at 8 miles and language at 4 miles “ these are line of an poet I don’t remember his name but they do describe how diverse India can be, I am pretty proud of its heritage and history. To know I am Hindu boy, so I grew knowing stories of Indian gods to tell anyone how they are I would say friendly, they are like our friend. There is one Hindu scripture ”Bhagvat Geeta”  which refer to ideology  that we all are one , we are god it’s just that we haven’t  realised it ourself. Which ultimately says that “we shouldn’t do anything to other which we won’t do to ourselves”, for me this created the base of beliefs for which I am happy. Well let’s end ideological topic and move on something else.</p>
          <p>Hard life is not anything that I faced my life was pretty calm and peaceful and would definitely love to be that way moving on . I have studied in a school near by my house, I spent around 12 years at that school out of which I needed around 11 years to consider my fellow student my friends but within 1.5 year I needed to leave them for my future study which definitely get halted by coronavirus, still now it is hard for me to make friends but definitely have enough connections that they will do a work for me.</p>
          <p>I don’t have idea about how much I should present in this problem statement so I think I should stop now. To end and add something up i am follower  of Stotic ideology. This essay definitly had made you know i don't like opening up and i also lack communication skills so hope these would be considred as details and you will make do with this.</p>
